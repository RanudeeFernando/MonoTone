[Speaker A]: Are you bringing it to the game?
[Speaker B]: Yeah, I don't want to leave it. And maybe we're going to the game.
[Speaker A]: Where are we going now?
[Speaker B]: To see someone about my job.
[Speaker A]: I don't understand.
[Speaker B]: You don't understand what?
[Speaker A]: Are we going to the game?
[Speaker B]: I said possibly we're going to the game. You know what possibly means?
[Speaker A]: Like probably.
[Speaker B]: No, probably means there's a good chance that we're gone. Possibly means we might, we might not. What does probably mean?
[Speaker A]: It means we have a good chance.
[Speaker B]: And what does possibly mean?
[Speaker A]: I know what it means.
[Speaker B]: What does it mean?
[Speaker A]: It means that we're not going to the game.
[Speaker B]: How did you get so smart? Cause you're smart.
[Speaker A]: Are we there?
[Speaker B]: Yeah. Mr. Ribbon?
[Speaker C]: Yes.
[Speaker B]: How are you, sir? Chris Gardiner.
[Speaker C]: Dean Witter. Oh, hi. Hi.
[Speaker B]: This is my son, Christopher.
[Speaker A]: Hi.
[Speaker C]: Hey, Christopher. What are you doing up here?
[Speaker B]: I came to apologize for missing our appointment the other day.
[Speaker C]: Oh, you need to come up?
[Speaker B]: Oh, actually, we were in the neighborhood visiting a very close friend of ours. And I just wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you for your time. I know you probably waited for me a little bit. I want you to know that I do not take that for granted.
[Speaker C]: No, come on. What's that?
[Speaker B]: Oh, this? An Osteo national bone density scanner.
[Speaker C]: Oh.
[Speaker B]: A company I bought into prior to going to work at Witter. I have a meeting after the game.
[Speaker C]: You guys going to the game?
[Speaker A]: Oh, yeah, possibly.
[Speaker B]: Possibly.
[Speaker C]: We're going to. I'm taking my son, Tim. My 12 year old. We were just leaving.
[Speaker B]: Tim. Listen, we'll get out of your way. Again, thank you very much, and I'm sorry about the other day and I hope that we can reschedule for later this week.
[Speaker C]: You got it.
[Speaker B]: Thank you very much, sir. You take care. Here, come on. Say bye bye, Chris. Bye.
[Speaker C]: Bye, Christopher.
[Speaker B]: Hey, you guys want to come with us to Candlestick?
[Speaker C]: We're going now. Come with us. Where are your seats?
[Speaker B]: We are upper deck.
[Speaker C]: We got a box. Come on. You want to sit in the box?
[Speaker A]: No.
[Speaker B]: Well, it's not actually a box. It's. It's a private section. It's more comfortable. You wanna go?
[Speaker A]: Okay.
[Speaker C]: Okay, kids, in the back. Hey, why don't you just put that in your car?
[Speaker B]: Yeah, sure, sure.
[Speaker A]: We don't have a car.
[Speaker B]: Ah. Oh, my.
[Speaker C]: What happened?
[Speaker B]: I think I got stung by a bee.
[Speaker C]: You all right?
[Speaker B]: Oh, yeah.
[Speaker C]: Ah.
[Speaker B]: Goodness. I'm fine. I'm fine.
[Speaker C]: You're not allergic or anything?
[Speaker B]: No, no, no.
[Speaker C]: Where'd he get you?
[Speaker B]: Just, like, right in the back. Of my head.
[Speaker A]: Are you okay?
[Speaker B]: Yeah, I'm fine. Christopher.
[Speaker A]: Does it hurt?
[Speaker C]: Hey, Christopher.
[Speaker B]: I'm fine.
[Speaker A]: Let me see.
[Speaker B]: Christopher, sit back. Sit back.
